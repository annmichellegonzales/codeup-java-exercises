////        i notice that the char doesn't work for this. I got prompted to use string instead of var.

//        double myString;
//        myString = 3.14159;
//        System.out.print(myString);
        //char does not work, var does. prompted by intelli j to use double.

//        float myNumber = (float) 3.14;
//        System.out.print(myNumber);
        // it says illegal for empty, doesn't like 3.14 as long. 123L works for long. 123 worked because..
        // it didn't have a decimal??
        // for float, i got prompted to cast float

//        int x = 5;
//        System.out.println(x++);
//        System.out.println(x);
        // i got 5 and 6 on seperate lines
//
//        int x = 5;
//        System.out.println(++x);
//        System.out.println(x);
        // i got 6 and 6 for this one
        // i understand that the pre increment, and post increment lead to different behaviors of what to do with the int variable.
        // i think because the post increment will increment after the code is executed, which added the one to the number 5

        //class doesn't like being a variable.. it seems...

//        String theNumberThree = "three";
//        Object o = theNumberThree;
//        int three = (int) o;
//        int three = (int) "three";
//        System.out.println(three);
        // got an error. probly cuz "three" is a string that cannot be converted into an int
        // didn't like this either with a different error. incompatible types. same reasons, different nests.
